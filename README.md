# xmrig-cuda-linux binary
This file was created while experimenting a bit with mining cryptocurrency. Since the **NVIDIA** plugin is no longer bundled with the original repo we have to compile it for our own use. Because it takes some time to complie it, I'm sharing my file to save you some time.

>As a rule of thumb never accept files uploaded by strangers on the internet. But I can guarantee this build is clean ;)

Built on `Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS`


Happy mining!
